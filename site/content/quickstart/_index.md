Welcome to the [github.com/g4s8/openbots](https://github.com/g4s8/openbots) and
[chatbotcloud.org](https://chatbotcloud.org) Quick Start guide!

These pages are created to help:
 1. Choosing Cloud vs Self-Hosted version.
 2. Installing binaries for self-hosted bot or creating bot in the Cloud.
 3. Writing your first bot spec.
 4. And deploying it to Cloud or running at Self-Hosted instance.

Let's go to the first topic and choose deployment options by comparing different options!
