Before you start creating a new bot,
you need to decide whether to use [the self-hosted](#self-hosted-version) version or
[the Cloud](#start-bot-at-chatbotcloudorg) version
available at [chatbotcloud.org](https://chatbotcloud.org).
This documentation provides instructions for both versions.


## Self hosted version

To run a self hosted version you can download a binary or run Docker image.

### Running binary

You can download the binary release from
[github.com/g4s8/openbots/releases](https://github.com/g4s8/openbots/releases):
```bash
# example for Linux x86_64
wget https://github.com/g4s8/openbots/releases/download/<version>/openbots_<version>_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
tar -xvzf openbots_0.0.4_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz 
rm openbots_0.0.4_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
```

Thenn you need to specify Telegram bot token (you can get it from [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)),
see [Telegram docs](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api), and spec path:
```bash
BOT_TOKEN="110201543:AAHdqTcvCH1vGWJxfSeofSAs0K5PALDsaw" ./openbots -config bot.yml
```

### Running Docker image

```bash
docker run --rm --name openbots \
  --env BOT_TOKEN="110201543:AAHdqTcvCH1vGWJxfSeofSAs0K5PALDsaw" \
  -v $PWD/bot.yml:/w/config.yml \
  g4s8/openbots:latest
```

Donâ€™t forget to provide your actual bot token via `--env BOT_TOKEN` argument instead of placeholder,
and actual bot spec file path.
